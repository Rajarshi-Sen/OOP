 Welcome to Assignment 7: 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 Electronic brains can reduce the profusion of dead ends involved in
 vital research. But they can't eliminate the foolishness and decay
 that come from the unexamined life. Nor do they connect a man to the
 things he has to be connected to--- the reality of pain in others; the
 possibilities of creative growth in himself; the memory of the race;
 and the rights of the next generation.

 The reason these matters are important in a computerized age is that
 there may be a tendency to mistake data for wisdom, just as there has
 always been a tendency to confuse logic with values, and intelligence
 with insight. Unobstructed access to facts can produce unlimited good
 only if it is matched by the desire and ability to find out what they
 mean and where they would lead.
